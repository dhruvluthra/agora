## Introducing **Agora**: A New Platform to Organize Office Hours

Running office hours is difficult. A lot of people show up, and a lot of them need help. Agora is a new mobile application that allows professor and teaching assistants to more efficiently manage their time, allowing them to help as many people as possible. 

### How It Works
Agora simplifies office hours by allowing students to sign up for office hours ahead of time, ensuring they don't waste time and are only at office hours when the teacher is available to help them. Students can enter what they need help with- so that if a group of students needs help on the same topic, the teacher can address the entire group instead of having to address each student individually. Each office hours session also creates a forum on which the teacher can answer common questions, post pictures, and interact with with the students.


### Progress

The application is currently in early stage develop.
