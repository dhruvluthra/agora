## Introducing **Agora**: A New Mobile Platform to Manage Office Hours

Running office hours is difficult. A lot of people show up, and they all need help- most of the time, from one person. Agora is a new mobile application that allows professor and teaching assistants to more efficiently manage their time, allowing them to help as many people as possible.

### How It Works
Agora simplifies office hours by allowing students to sign up for office hours ahead of time, ensuring they don't waste time and are only at office hours when the teacher is available to help them. Students can enter what they need help with- so that if a group of students needs help on the same topic, the teacher can address the entire group instead of having to address each student individually. Each office hours session also creates a forum on which the teacher can answer common questions, post pictures, and interact with with the students.


### Progress

The application is currently in early stage develop.
- Alpha Stage Check Up (April 18, 2017): We have created a formal home screen which allows the user to login to a previously created account or create a new account if they do not have one. This account feature was implemented using Firebase's authentication feature. After the user has logged in, they are taken to the home screen which will be the pivot point for the rest of the functionality of application, with the option to create or join an office hours session and/or quit the application. The functionality of the home screen is the next step of completion: mainly, the creation and management of the session, likely using Firebase's realtime database functionality.
